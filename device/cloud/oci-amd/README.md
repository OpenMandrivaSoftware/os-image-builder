Installing OpenMandriva AMD on OCI
----------------------------------
In the Oracle web console:

Go to Storage -> Buckets
Create and enter a bucket
Select Upload
Upload the qcow2 file generated by os-image-builder

Go to Compute -> Custom Images
Import image
Use "Import from an Object Storage bucket"
Select the bucket and file you've uploaded before
Set Image Type to qcow2
Click Import image

Wait for the "create image" work request to finish

Go to "Edit details" and tell it what shapes are compatible.
The AMD image should work for anything that uses an AMD processor
(NOT Intel or ARM). At the time of writing, this would be
VM.Standard.E3.Flex, VM.Standard.E4.Flex, BM.Standard.E3.128,
 and BM.Standard.E4.128

Go to "Edit image details" and uncheck the BIOS option, we
do only UEFI.

The image is now ready to be used - use "Create Instance"
to set up a new machine.
